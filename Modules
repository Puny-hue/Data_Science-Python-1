Groups related - tools together.
Makes it easy to know where to look for a perticular tool.
Common examples:
               * Matplotlib - Creat a Chats.
               * Pandas - Learn tabula data.
               * Scikit - which performs Machine learning.
               * Scipy  - Contain Statstics.
               * nltk   - Help textdata.
 import pandas as pd
 from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

- Pandas gives us the tools to read data from the file.
- Matplotlib gives us the tools to plot the data.
- seaborn gives us a visualisation library, usually aliased as sns.

Each modules has a standard alias, which allows you to access the tools inside of the module
without typing a many character. EX : aliasing lets shorten
Seaborn, scatterplot(), to sns.seatterplot().
